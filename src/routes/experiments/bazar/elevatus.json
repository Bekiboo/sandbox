However, the monthly tuition fee of 65,000 Ar [Ariary, the currency of Madagascar] poses a challenge. Although she commutes the 60km distance from her hometown to the university only during vacation periods, financial constraints persist. Obtaining a laptop is imperative for her studies, yet her sick father's inability to work and her mother's efforts to support the family leave them unable to afford this essential tool. Consequently, her mother seeks assistance to procure the laptop, recognizing its crucial role in Rinah's education."

With her mother being the sole breadwinner, and with siblings still in high school, including one in the final year aiming for the BACC this year, any form of assistance would be immensely appreciated as she remains committed to her educational journey."
